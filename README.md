# tic_tac_toe_tt

## The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## Download the tech test

```
$ git clone https://github.com/andygjenkins/tic_tac_toe_tt.git
$ bundle
$ rspec
$ irb||pry
```


### Progress:
- [ ] Write tests for initializing a game: presence of a board, players
- [ ] Pass tests for game
- [ ] Write tests for taking turns: selecting a field, switching players
- [ ] Pass tests for turns
- [ ] Write tests for game logic: win == all fields in a row, column or diagonal  
- [ ] Pass test for game logic

### Further steps:
- [ ] Refactor code for command line interface
- [ ] Add code for printing game progress to stdout
